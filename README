DESCRIPTION

    The Extorter module allows you to create import lists which extract
    routines from the package(s) specified. It will import routines found
    in the package variables @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and %EXPORT_TAGS, or,
    extract routines defined in the package which are not explicitly
    exported. Otherwise, as a last resort, Extorter will try to load the
    package, using a parameterized use statement, in the event that the
    package has a custom or magical importer that does not conform to the
    Exporter interface.

    Extorter accepts a list of fully-qualified declarations. The verbosity
    of the declarations are meant to promote explicit, clean, and
    reasonable import lists. Extorter has the added bonus of extracting
    functionality from packages which may not have originally been designed
    to be imported. Declarations are handled in the order in which they're
    declared, which means, as far as the import and/or extraction order
    goes, the last routine declared will be the one available to your
    program and any redefine warnings will be suppressed. This is a feature
    not a bug. NOTE: Any declaration prefixed with an asterisk is assumed
    to be a fully-qualified namespace of a package and is imported
    directly.

    The into function declared in the extort package, used as a kind of
    global method invokable by any package, is designed to load and import
    the specified @declarations, as showcased in the synopsis, into the
    $target package.

        $package->extort::into($target, @declarations);
    
        e.g.
    
        $package->extort::into($package, 'Scalar::Util::blessed');
        $package->extort::into($package, 'Scalar::Util::refaddr');
        $package->extort::into($package, 'Scalar::Util::reftype');
        $package->extort::into($package, 'Scalar::Util::weaken');
    
        $package->extort::into($target, 'List::AllUtils::distinct');
        $package->extort::into($target, 'List::AllUtils::firstval');
        $package->extort::into($target, 'List::AllUtils::lastval');
        $package->extort::into($target, 'List::AllUtils::pairs');
        $package->extort::into($target, 'List::AllUtils::part');
        $package->extort::into($target, 'List::AllUtils::uniq');
